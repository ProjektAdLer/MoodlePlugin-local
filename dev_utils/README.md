# Warning

This folder contains a collection of scripts that I use for different purposes, mostly for development and testing. 
**The scripts are not meant to be used in production, but rather as a tool for development and testing.**
Later on these scripts will likely be moved to a separate repository, but for now they are kept here.

These files are and will never be tested. **See them as inspiration / reference or forget that they even exist.**

There's also no guarantee that they will work on the plugin version you are using. I will only update them if I need them.
